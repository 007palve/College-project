## "Optimized data storage using sharding method in blockchain technology."
# Abstracct
The sharding scheme is highly useful and an effective mechanism to improve the storage and improve the volume of the database. Majority of the data being stored across the world is stored in conventional techniques in servers and workstations. As the amount of data keeps increasing every single day, these systems need to be able to scale up and allow for more data storage within the existing infrastructure. This is a big challenge as the conventional approaches are not as effective in achieving the scaling of the storage infrastructure with certain limitations that are inherent towards a centralized implementation of the databases. Therefore, the utilization of the decentralized sharding mechanism can help in achieving effective scalability and improved volume of the storage. The conventional approaches for the purpose of achieving the scaling of the existing database architecture are not sufficient for the current influx of data. Data nowadays has increased in value and volume that demands for an improvement in the infrastructure to be able to store more data efficiently and with improved security. The sharding strategy is one of the leading strategies that have been effective in the overcoming the scalability problem that plagues the traditional databases. Therefore, to provide a solution for this a data sharding approach has been defined in this research article that utilizes Linear Clustering and sharding through the Blockchain Framework along with Bilinear Pairing for Data Integrity report generation. The approach has been evaluated effectively through experimentation to achieve satisfactory results.

# Introduction
Sharding is a method employed in blockchain to enhance data storage and processing efficiency. In this optimization technique, the entire dataset is divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards. Each shard operates independently, allowing for parallel processing and reducing the load on individual nodes. This approach improves scalability as multiple nodes can work on different shards simultaneously, enhancing overall network performance. By implementing sharding in blockchain data storage, the system achieves better resource utilization, increased throughput, and a more resilient infrastructure to accommodate the demands of a growing decentralized ecosystem.

# Problem Statement
To effectively perform data sharding approach using the effective feature extraction and deployment of a private distributed blockchain framework along with integrity evaluation using the Bilinear pairing technique

# Limitations of Existing System
1. Security risks: Sharding can introduce new security risks to the 	blockchain network. For example, if a single shard is compromised,  
   it can potentially affect the entire network.
2. Data availability: Sharding can make it more difficult to access data stored on the blockchain. If a node goes offline or loses its data,
   it can be difficult to retrieve that data.
3. Complexity: Sharding can add complexity to a blockchain network, making it more difficult to develop and maintain.

# Hardware and Software Requirements
## Software Requirements: 
Coding Language : Java
Operating System : Windows 10
## Hardware Requirements:
RAM : 8 GB
Hard Disk : 40 GB
Processor : Intel i5

# Advantages
Scalability: Sharding can significantly increase the transaction throughput of a blockchain network by allowing transactions to be processed in parallel on each shard.
Efficiency: Sharding can reduce the computational resources required to process transactions on a blockchain network, making it more efficient and cost-effective.
Security: Sharding can improve security of  blockchain networks by making it more difficult for hackers to compermise the system. if single shard is Compromised , it will not affect entire network

# Applicaations
Decentralized storage: Sharding can be used to create a decentralized storage system that is more secure and 	reliable than traditional cloud storage services.
Supply chain management: Sharding can be used to 	create a more efficient and transparent supply chain 	management system.
Healthcare: Sharding can be used to create a secure and private healthcare system that allows patients to control their own medical records.
Voting systems: Sharding can be used to create a more secure and transparent voting system.

# Conclusion
The Proposed approach an effective Data Sharding scheme that is developed on the Blockchain Framework. Data nowadays has increased in value and volume that demands for an improvement in the infrastructure to be able to store more data efficiently and with improved security. The sharding strategy is one of the leading strategies that have been effective in the overcoming the scalability problem that plagues the traditional databases. The presented approach utilizes Linear Clustering along with the Blockchain framework to enable a secure and efficient data sharding approach on the Mongo DB database.
